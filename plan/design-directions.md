# CrashMirror polish directions (2025-02-14)

## 1. Neo-brutalist dashboard
- **Visual language**: bold typography, high-contrast neutrals with one accent color (e.g., cobalt).
- **Layout**: two-column grid; left column sticky with portfolio + scenario controls, right column scrollable results.
- **Widgets**: blocky cards with subtle grain/noise backgrounds; thin separators rather than drop shadows.
- **Chart treatment**: flat fills, minimal axes, annotations using monospace captions to keep the utilitarian feel.
- **Extras**: inline “source” chips under each panel, keyboard shortcuts (“1” to switch scenarios) surfaced near the badge.

## 2. Financial terminal aesthetic
- **Visual language**: dark theme with saturated greens/reds, small caps, data-grid patterns reminiscent of Bloomberg.
- **Layout**: tabbed results area (“Overview”, “Composition”, “Narrative”); collapsible left rail for scenarios.
- **Widgets**: ticker-style badges showing % change, micro sparklines embedded in the Top Drivers list.
- **Chart treatment**: add crosshair + precise tooltips; waterfall becomes column-style chart with gridlines.
- **Extras**: optional “historical context” side drawer with quick comparables (e.g., 2008, COVID shock).

## 3. Editorial explainer
- **Visual language**: light background, serif headlines, generous whitespace, animated transitions on scenario change.
- **Layout**: story-like flow—hero summary, charts interleaved with copy, culminates in “What this means” panel.
- **Widgets**: pull-quotes for key numbers (“Your net worth falls 32%”), callout cards for assumptions/sources.
- **Chart treatment**: softer palettes with translucency; callout dots to highlight peaks or major contributors.
- **Extras**: shareable summary (“Copy summary” button) and a print/PDF layout for off-platform sharing.

## 4. Minimalist planner
- **Visual language**: muted pastel palette, rounded corners, gentle shadows.
- **Layout**: single column on desktop with collapsible sections; mobile-first approach with swipeable scenario cards.
- **Widgets**: progress bars for portfolio coverage (“You’ve covered 4 of 6 asset classes”), quick sliders for scenario stress.
- **Chart treatment**: radial charts for composition, stacked area for before/after comparisons.
- **Extras**: inline “next actions” checklist (e.g., “Consider diversifying bonds”), toggled via accordions.

## 5. At-a-glance KPI wall
- **Visual language**: glassmorphism, translucent panels, energetic gradients.
- **Layout**: hero KPI row (Current vs After vs Delta), responsive tile grid for charts/notes.
- **Widgets**: animated counters, iconography for each asset class, badge for scenario confidence (“Historic analog” vs “What-if”).
- **Chart treatment**: more dynamic—animated transitions on scenario switch, drill-down on click.
- **Extras**: scenario carousel with preview thumbnails, optional “compare scenarios” toggle to overlay charts.
